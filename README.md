# tanubha20--Pclub-Game_of_Blocks-
In this repository ,I will be putting all the codes that I will create in the project "Game of Blocks" assigned to me by Programming club.

ASSIGNMENT 1 - in PYTHON and JAVA

Here , I have created my assignment 1 in both python and java language.

My explanation and output here goes for PYTHON.

I imported hashlib library to to generate Hashcode for Strings.

I imported time library to calculate and print the time required for execution.

First , I took a string input from the user.

Then , I started appending numbers at the end of enterd strings starting from 0 till I hit required number using variable x incrementing it on every go.

After appending the number, HashCode Generated by SHA-256 for appended String is checked if first five terms of it are all zero or not.

If it satisfies Line 6, our c becomes 1 and condition of while becomes false and our while loop finishes execution.

Variable tempS stores the entered string appended with found number in String type.

Variable newResult stores the HashCode Generated by SHA-256 for tempS.

Print the time it takes to get this nonce value. 

Finally, we print the required result.


My Output-


1.
Enter a string athassin
The hexadecimal equivalent of  athassin  is : 
8ef3077cb696aaf9339b9530d428ed50dfb714667cea6bf57322dde4cbbd7b58
Number 918687
Required HashCode Generated by SHA-256 for entered String - 0000094c8b0f27114bc994f9378ec2617395753dfc26b4babec55f0aaaea39c1
Total runtime of the program is 1.8711137771606445

2.
Enter a string Engineering
The hexadecimal equivalent of  Engineering  is : 
729bb48d0f86a9e240a9839bf8c50f62f7ed973338514432666cf53c5d30c9ca
Number 823161
Required HashCode Generated by SHA-256 for entered String - 0000097242076b24be19af7c0b5849da5579f0b7fd6b6ed2d3757255e1615352
Total runtime of the program is 1.6883270740509033
