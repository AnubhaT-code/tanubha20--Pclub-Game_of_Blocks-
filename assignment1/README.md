# tanubha20--Pclub-Game_of_Blocks-
In this repository ,I will be putting all the codes that I will create in the project "Game of Blocks" assigned to me by Programming club.
Here , I have created my assignment 1 in python language.
I imported hashlib library to to generate Hashcode for Strings.
I imported time library to calculate and print the time required for execution.
First , I took a string input from the user.
Then , I started appending numbers at the end of enterd strings starting from 0 till I hit required number using variable x incrementing it on every go.
After appending the number, HashCode Generated by SHA-256 for appended String is checked if first five terms of it are all zero or not.
If it satisfies Line 6, our c becomes 1 and condition of while becomes false and our while loop finishes execution.
Variable tempS stores the entered string appended with found number in String type.
Variable newResult stores the HashCode Generated by SHA-256 for tempS.
Print the time it takes to get this nonce value. 
Finally, we print the required result.
